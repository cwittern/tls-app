        <h3>Wildcards</h3>
        <p>A full stop, '.', (not between brackets), without any qualifiers: Matches a single arbitrary character.</p>
        <p>A full stop, '.', (not between brackets), immediately followed by a single question mark, '?': Matches either no characters or one character.</p>
        <p>A full stop, '.', (not between brackets), immediately followed by a single asterisk, '*': Matches zero or more characters.</p>
        <p>A full stop, '.', (not between brackets), immediately followed by a single plus sign, '+': Matches one or more characters.</p>
        <p>A full stop, '.', immediately followed by a sequence of characters that matches the regular expression {[0-9]+,[0-9]+}: Matches a number of characters, where the number is no less than the number represented by the series of digits before the comma, and no greater than the number represented by the series of digits following the comma.</p>
        <p>An expression "[â€¦]" matches a single character, namely any of the characters enclosed by the brackets. The string enclosed by the brackets cannot be empty; therefore ']' can be allowed between the brackets, provided that it is the first character.(Thus, "[][?]" matches the three characters '[', ']' and '?'.)A circumflex accent, '^', at the start of the search string matches the start of the paragraph. A dollar sign, '$', at the end of the search string matches the end of the paragraph. </p>
            <p>One can remove the special meaning of any character mentioned above by preceding them by a backslash. Between brackets these characters stand for themselves. Thus, "[[?*\]" matchesthe four characters '[', '?', '*' and '\'.'?', '*', '+' and character sequences matching the regular expression {[0-9]+,[0-9]+} not immediately preceeded by an unescaped period, '.', stand for themselves. '^' and '$' not at the very beginning or end of the search string, respectively, stand for themselves.</p>
