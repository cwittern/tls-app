#+TITLE: TLS app

This is the eXist-db application for presenting the TLS on the Web. To install, create the xar files and upload to eXist-db.  In addition to this app, there are two dependencies:

- tls-data:  The lexical part of the database, including attributions and translations
- tls-texts: The source texts

There are submodules for both repositories which contain restricted
data that can't be distributed.
